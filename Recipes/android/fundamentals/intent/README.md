An Intent is an abstract concept for some sort of operation that should be
performed in the Android OS. It's often used to launch external applications
with the *intent* to do something, such as make a phone call, display a
web page, or map an address. As such, an Intent generally has two pieces of
informtion associated with it; first, what the intent is (as in make a phone
call), and second, what data does the intent need (such as a phone number) to
perform the intention.
