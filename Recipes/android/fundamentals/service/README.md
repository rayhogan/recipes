A service in Android represents a process who's lifecycle is not necessarily
tied to the lifecycle of an activity and has no UI. As such, it's used to
perform background tasks even when an application is not in the foreground. For
example, if you were creating a music player application, you would want to
create a service that runs in the background and manages the playing of audio,
as well as a song queue, etc.
