Working with the file system in iOS is not unlike working with the file
system in .NET from Windows. You can still use the System.IO classes that
you’re used to working with, such as Directory, File, and the like, but there
are a few restrictions to be aware of. Additionally, it’s important to
understand the directory structure specific to iOS applications to know
where and when to store things.
