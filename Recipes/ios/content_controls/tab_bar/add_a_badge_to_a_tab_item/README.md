# Recipe

A badge is a small red oval with white border than is displayed over the
top-right corner of a tab. It is usually used to indicate the number of new
items that will be displayed when the tab is selected (such as the Updates tab
in the App Store).

 ![](Images/Picture_1.png)

A badge will appear on a tab if the BadgeValue property is set:

```
tab.TabBarItem.BadgeValue = "3";
```

To remove a badge that has been previously displayed, set the property to
null:

```
tab.TabBarItem.BadgeValue = null;
```

# Additional Information

You cannot use an empty string to clear the badge â€“ that will result in the
red and white circle appearing without any content.
