The Split View controller is a content control that can be used to display
two view controllers with a master-detail relationship. This controller can only
be used on the iPad.

# Split View Master-Detail Behavior

When the split view is displayed on an iPad that is in a vertical orientation, the master list is hidden until the user swipes from the edge at the language start direction. When the split view is displayed on an iPad that is in the horizontal orientation, the master list is permanently displayed adjacent to the edge at the language start direction.
