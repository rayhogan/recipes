With the introduction of iOS 9, Apple has released two new frameworks, Contacts and ContactsUI, that replace the existing Address Book and Address Book UI frameworks used by iOS 8 and earlier.

The two new frameworks contain the following functionality:

* **Contacts** - Provides access to the user's contact list data. Because most apps only require read-only access, this framework has been optimized for thread safe, read-only access.
* **ContactsUI** - Provides Xamarin.iOS UI elements to display, edit, select and create contacts on iOS devices.
