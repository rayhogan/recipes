iOS includes very sophisticated animation APIs that can make your application
feel much more immersive and cinematic, giving that feel of quality users have
come to expect in iOS applications. For simple animations, view-based animations
offer a quick and easy way to automatically animate view transitions and
changes. For more complex animations, there's a very sophisticated API.
