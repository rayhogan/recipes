==============

Recipes are a short form way to explain how to use a certain feature. To enable users to have the best experience with your recipe we encourage you to consider the following guidelines  when writing.

* Use a numbered list for each step in the process. This helps users to follow along with your recipe. 
* Use screenshots as often as you need to. Screenshots are a good way to clarify anything that may be ambiguous, or to set a checkpoint for the user so that they are assured they are following the steps correctly. 
    * When taking a screenshot, make sure to focus on the relevant information. 
* Add any code that might be useful. Users like code! Always advise in which file, and where, the code should be placed. 
* Explain briefly what is happening within the code snippet, if you think it will help the user.
